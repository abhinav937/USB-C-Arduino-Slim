# USB-C-Arduino-Slim <br />
An Arduino board with USB C port for data transfer and power.<br />
It bit lengthier than Nano. Because it has 2 voltage regulators(5V and 3.3V)<br />
## I'm not sure this is working or not.<br />
I just gave the order for PCB Facbrication. I'll be posting the review within End of Aug 2022.
