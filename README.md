[Download here](https://github.com/abhinav937/USB-C-Arduino-Slim/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)<br />
An Arduino board with USB C port for data transfer and power.<br />
It bit lengthier than Nano. Because it has 2 voltage regulators(5V and 3.3V)<br />
## I'm not sure this is working or not.<br />
I was not aware of Atmega328p-QFN pricesðŸ¥², I can't test it.
